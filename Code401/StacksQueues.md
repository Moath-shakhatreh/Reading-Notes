# Stack and Queus

> In computer science, stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used to store and organize data. They have distinct characteristics and are suited for different scenarios.

## What are Stacks?
```
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates; the last plate you put on top is the first one you need to remove. Similarly, in a stack, the most recently added item is the first one to be removed.

Key operations of a stack:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
```



## What are Queues?
```
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Think of a queue at a ticket counter; the person who arrives first gets served first. Similarly, in a queue, the first item added is the first one to be removed.

Key operations of a queue:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element from the queue.
Front: Returns the front element without removing it.

Example:

An example of a queue is a print spooler. When multiple print jobs are sent to a printer, they are added to the queue. The printer processes each job in the order they were added, ensuring fairness.
```

## Conclusion:
```
 Stacks and queues are essential data structures used in various algorithms and applications. Stacks are LIFO-based, while queues are FIFO-based. Understanding their characteristics and operations will help you solve problems and design efficient algorithms.

Review of Classmate's Lesson: One of my classmates explained the concept of stacks really well, emphasizing the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They also provided a great example of a call stack, highlighting how functions are pushed and popped from the stack during program execution.Â
