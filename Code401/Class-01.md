## Class-01 
Reading this topics (Pain and Suffering and Beginners Guide to Big O) helped me to continue in this course and understanding some topics that I was not understanding it correctly 

### Reading Questions
1-In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles: 

We will be pushed emotionally, constantly confronted with our own lack of understanding of a topic, we will be pushed mentally, having to think our way through problems that we had only even heard about a few hours beforehand.

2-After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity:

Time complexity is a function that describes how long an algorithm takes in terms of the quantity of input it receives. Space complexity is a function that describes how much memory (space) an algorithm requires to the quantity of input to the method.

3-Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python:

In python, some variables can change their value after creation while some cannot. Therefore, if a variable can change its value it is mutable in nature. Otherwise, if it cannot change its value after creation it is immutable in nature.

### Things I want to know more about:

algorithms that need to operate at scale
