## Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structures are being used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. Moreover, data structures come under the fundamentals of Computer Science and Software Engineering. It is a key topic when it comes to Software Engineering interview questions. Hence as developers, we must have good knowledge about data structures.



A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

Recursion

Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.

Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It is especially good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach .

Big O

“Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation.”

In plain words, Big O notation describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms.

Discussion Questions

1-What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
It is important to state that no single data structure serves as an optimal solution for all problems. With that in mind, to pick the best data structure to solve a particular problem, we have to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform and how often they are going to be .

2-How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
Infinite recursion is avoided by ensure that progress is made toward the basis case or cases in every recursive call.
