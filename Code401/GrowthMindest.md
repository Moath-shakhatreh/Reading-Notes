## The Growth Mindset

What Having a “Growth Mindset” Actually Means ?

To briefly sum up the findings: Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. 

They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). 

This is because they worry less about looking smart and put more energy into learning. When entire companies embrace a growth mindset, their employees report feeling far more empowered and committed; they also receive greater organizational support for collaboration and innovation. 

In contrast, people at primarily fixed-mindset companies report more cheating and deception among employees, presumably to gain an advantage in the talent race.


### Here are three common misconceptions: 

1- I already have, and have always had, a growth mindset,A pure growth mindset doesn’t exist, which we must acknowledge to attain the benefits we seek. 

2- A growth mindset is just about praising and rewarding effort.It’s critical to reward not just effort but learning and progress, and to emphasize the processes that yield these things, such as seeking help from others, trying new strategies, and capitalizing on setbacks to move forward effectively.

3- Just espouse a growth mindset, and good things will happen, Mission statements are wonderful things. You can’t argue with lofty values like growth, empowerment, and innovation. But they are meaningless to employees if the company doesn’t implement policies that make these values real and attainable.
