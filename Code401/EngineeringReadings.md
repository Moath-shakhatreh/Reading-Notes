## Engineering Readings

### Solve problems

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

1-Try a solution.

2-If that doesn’t work, try another one.

3-If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.

The best way involves 

a- having a framework and 

b- practicing it.

“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.

Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.

### How you value your time is how you value your life

“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? 

Would you waste one on being angry?”
You have very few hours here on on this earth.

Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.

The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.

### Discussion Questions

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

 You should highlight the skills and experience that will help you succeed in the position and at the company; likely, the ones you've already touched on in your resume and cover letter. Also, emphasize your strengths, and most importantly—what differentiates you from the rest of the interviewee pack.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

 Take the problem concrete · Write out exactly what you're trying to do · Simplify your given input · Solve a smaller problem · Take a break
