>Observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout my course.

## Relational databases and SQL
 >Relational databases store data in tables. Tables can grow large and have a multitude of columns and records. Relational database management systems (RDBMSs) use SQL (and variants of SQL) to manage the data in these large tables. The RDBMS you use is your choice and depends on the complexity of your application.

## Observations and learnings about Command Line

>The command line is a quick, powerful, text-based interface developers use to more effectively and efficiently communicate with computers to accomplish a wider set of tasks. </p>
One of the biggest advantages I liked is its branching capabilities.


## The Growth Mindset
What Having a “Growth Mindset” Actually Means ?
To briefly sum up the findings: Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and put more energy into learning. When entire companies embrace a growth mindset, their employees report feeling far more empowered and committed; they also receive greater organizational support for collaboration and innovation. In contrast, people at primarily fixed-mindset companies report more cheating and deception among employees, presumably to gain an advantage in the talent race.

>Here are three common misconceptions:</p>
1- I already have, and have always had, a growth mindset,A pure growth mindset doesn’t exist, which we must acknowledge to attain the benefits we seek. </p>
2- A growth mindset is just about praising and rewarding effort.It’s critical to reward not just effort but learning and progress, and to emphasize the processes that yield these things, such as seeking help from others, trying new strategies, and capitalizing on setbacks to move forward effectively.</p>
3- Just espouse a growth mindset, and good things will happen, Mission statements are wonderful things. You can’t argue with lofty values like growth, empowerment, and innovation. But they are meaningless to employees if the company doesn’t implement policies that make these values real and attainable.
