>Observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout my course.

## Relational databases and SQL
 >Relational databases store data in tables. Tables can grow large and have a multitude of columns and records. Relational database management systems (RDBMSs) use SQL (and variants of SQL) to manage the data in these large tables. The RDBMS you use is your choice and depends on the complexity of your application.

## Observations and learnings about Command Line

>The command line is a quick, powerful, text-based interface developers use to more effectively and efficiently communicate with computers to accomplish a wider set of tasks. 
One of the biggest advantages I liked is its branching capabilities.
